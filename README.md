Due to the large size of the data used, it cannot be directly transferred to this GitHub repository. Therefore, only the code for machine learning training (code_training.tar.gz), the code for forecasting (code_prediction.tar.gz), and information for 309 cities (CnameE.mat) are stored here. The data obtained from https://doi.org/10.11888/Atmos.tpdc.301316 includes more than 309 cities, which can be extracted using the Cname provided here.
